## 🗺️ Map Format

Each map is a text-based `.ber` file with the following characters:

| Symbol | Meaning           |
|--------|-------------------|
| `0`    | Empty space       |
| `1`    | Wall              |
| `P`    | Player start      |
| `C`    | Collectible item  |
| `E`    | Exit              |

Map Rules:
- Must be rectangular
- Surrounded by walls
- Includes **at least one** `P`, `C`, and `E`
- A valid path must exist between `P` and `E`

## ❌ Error Handling

The program handles and reports various types of errors to ensure smooth gameplay:

- 🚫 **Invalid map structure**: Non-rectangular maps or maps with holes
- ⚠️ **Missing required characters**: Map must contain at least one `P`, one `C`, and one `E`
- 🔄 **Non-rectangular maps**: All rows must have the same length
- 📂 **File open/read errors**: Missing `.ber` file or unreadable input
- 🧠 **Memory management & cleanup**: Frees all allocated memory upon exit or failure
